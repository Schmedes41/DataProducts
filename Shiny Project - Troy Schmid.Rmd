## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my 5-page required presentation.  

## Step 1

This app takes a user-selected integer and returns a probability based on that integer.

## Calculation Explanation

The integer selected determines how many heads the user would like to calculate the probability of within 20 coinflips.  Any adjustment to the slider will automatically recalculate the probability. 


## Visual Example
Here is an example of the final output: 

```{r prob}
paste("Probability of happening: ", dbinom(10, 20, 0.5), "%")
```

## Thank you for viewing my presentation.  I hope you find my app to be useful.
